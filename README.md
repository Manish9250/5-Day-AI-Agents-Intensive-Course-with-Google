# Google 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course
This repository documents my journey and solutions through Google's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive. It serves as a personal showcase of the concepts and skills I learned, from foundational components to building production-ready agentic systems.

The course, crafted by Google's ML researchers and engineers, covers the core pillars of AI agents:

- Models: The foundational LLMs that power agent reasoning.

- Tools: Enabling agents to interact with external systems and APIs.

- Orchestration: Managing the flow and logic of agent tasks.

- Memory: Providing agents with short-term and long-term context.

- Evaluation: Assessing and improving agent performance.

Inside, you'll find my solutions to codelabs, hands-on examples, and personal notes as I explored building, evaluating, and deploying agents for real-world problems.
